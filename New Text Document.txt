Methodology

The platform had implemented as a web app using HTML, CSS and JS for the frontend
and python(Flask) for the backend. All the datas from clients and appliers are 
registered on the database.


The online freelance platform provides a venue for employers and job seekers to 
meet and conduct business whether for part-time and full-time jobs as well as project 
based or long term commitments. The platform is web app where both freelancers & clients 
create accounts. The client posts jobs and freelancers make bids or apply for the job. 
After getting a few proposals, clients discuss with preferred freelancers and hire whom 
they want. Once the freelancer completes the job and delivers it, the buyer checks 
the work and approves it upon checking. After approving the work, the freelancing platform releases
 the fund to the freelancer. Then the buyer leaves feedback & ratings to the freelancer and also the 
freelancer does the same.


The best part about our platform is that it ensures the security of money both for freelancers and clients.
Both employees and employers are protected via escrow payments. A contract will not be paid until all 
stipulations in the agreement are not fulfilled. Furthermore, freelancers also have ratings which work best 
for everyone. Employers can see which freelancers have performed well and freelancers with great reviews find better jobs.
